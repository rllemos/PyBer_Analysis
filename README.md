# PyBer_Analysis
>Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
>Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
>Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Purpose:
To compare and contrast ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Overview of the analysis:
>1. To create a summary DataFrame of the ride_sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas.
>2. Using Pandas and Matplotlib create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
>3. Create a written report for the PyBer analysis that summarizes how the data differes by city type and how those differences can be used by decision_makers at PyBer.
